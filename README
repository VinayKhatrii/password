# Random Password Generator

This Python script is designed to generate secure random passwords for users. The passwords are generated using a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters. It ensures that the generated passwords are strong and not easily guessable.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine file directly. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Usage

To use the password generator, run the script `password_generator.py` in a Python environment. You will be prompted to specify the length of the password you wish to generate. Once the length is entered, the script will output a random password of the specified length.

## Example

```
from random_passwords import password
password_length = 5
new = password.generate_password(password_length)
print(new)

output: jfh$6

passwords = password.generate_multiple(password_length = 5, password_number = 3)
for password in passwords:
    print(password)

output:
sd%dd
ifd#$
```

## Customize

You can customize the script to adjust the character sets used for password generation. If you want to change the default behavior of the password generation, you can modify the character sets in the script.
